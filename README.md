# groceries_mobile


A local, privacy-first personal application designed to centralize daily life management by combining financial control, meal planning, and pantry management into a single modular interface.

🚀 Key Features
💰 Finance:
 - Management of current accounts, cash, and investment brokers (e.g., Directa, Binance) with multi-currency support (EUR and JPY) and live/offline exchange rates.  
 - Recording of expenses, income, and internal transfers (excluded from live expense statistics).  
 - Management of recurring expenses and income with quick execution.  
 - In-place editable transaction history and monthly category-aggregated reports.  
 📦 Possessions & Pantry:
 - Tracking of household inventory with intelligent measurement unit management and automatic conversions.  
 - Automatic clearing of depleted pantry items with direct transfer to the shopping list.  
 - Checkout feature that deducts funds from the chosen account, records the financial transaction, and refills the pantry.  
 🍳 Meals & Kitchen:
 - Recipe archive linked to ingredients.  
 - Weekly calendar for planning meal slots (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) with context management (At Home, Out, Offered by Me).  
 - Automatic consumption of ingredients from the pantry or immediate logging of restaurant costs.  
 - Integration with a local AI assistant (Ollama) for parsing natural language text and automatically populating the calendar.  
 ⚙️ Security & Backup:
 - Integrated system for automatic SQLite database backups with historical restore points.  


 📁 Repository Structure
 The project adopts a strictly decoupled and distributed architecture designed to separate business logic and data persistence from the user interface in view of future mobile migrations:
